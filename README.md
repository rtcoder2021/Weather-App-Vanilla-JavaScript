calling API 

The weather app displays the weather information it gets from the API like this, an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (18Â°C) in Celsius unit, the weather description (clear sky), and then the user's city and country (London, GB).

When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

The icons were created by the Graphic Designer Ashley Jager.
